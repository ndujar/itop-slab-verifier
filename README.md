## Mix wood-concrete beam calculator

Interactive verifier to compute the Ultimate Limit States and Service Limit States of combined wood + concrete slab reinforcements.

Very useful in the context of rehabilitation of historical buildings.
It provides the ratio between material capacity and applied tensions (ULS) and between admitted deflections (SLS), calculated according to Eurocodes.

It gives the following verifications:

**Ultimate Limit States**
Short Term Loads:
- Bending:
  - Concrete tension
  - Concrete compression
  - Wood bending
- Shear
- Unions

Long Term Loads:
- Bending:
  - Concrete tension
  - Concrete compression
  - Wood bending
- Shear
- Unions

**Service Limit States**
- Deflection

Note:

This project is based on a reference demo from [Netlify](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda/blob/main/README.md).
